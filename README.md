# Buckshot Roulette AI Patcher

This is a fork of Delta Patcher, a multi-platform patcher for mods. This fork is specifically designed to patch the AI in the game Buckshot Roulette, a turn-based strategy game where you have to outsmart your opponents in a deadly game of Russian roulette.

The original AI in Buckshot Roulette is very easy to beat, as it does not take into account the probability of each chamber being loaded, the number of players left, or the risk-reward ratio of each move. This patcher aims to improve the AI by making it more intelligent, adaptive, and unpredictable.

To use this patcher, you need to have the original Buckshot Roulette EXE file and the AI patch file. You can download the patch file from the Releases section of this repository. The patcher will create a new EXE file with the modified AI, which you can then play on your computer as normal.

To run the patcher, follow these steps:

- Download and extract the patcher for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac).
- Launch the patcher executable and select the original Buckshot Roulette ROM file and the AI patch file.
- Click on "Apply Patch" and wait for the process to finish.
- Enjoy the enhanced AI in Buckshot Roulette!

Note: This patcher is not affiliated with or endorsed by the developers of Buckshot Roulette. Use it at your own risk and discretion.
